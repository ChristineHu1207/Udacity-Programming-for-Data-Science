00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
This lesson introduces one of the most powerful concepts in

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,751
SQL data analysis, the window function.

3
00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:12,315
It allows you to compare one row to another without doing any joints.

4
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:16,480
That means you want to do simple things like create a running total,

5
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,820
as well as tricky things like determine whether

6
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:21,140
one row was greater than the previous row,

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,915
and classify it based on your finding.

8
00:00:23,915 --> 00:00:27,095
Most people SQL education ends before this.

9
00:00:27,095 --> 00:00:30,400
So, adding these skills to your toolkit and learning to use them in a number

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,030
of different situations will make you an extremely effective analyst.
