1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,620
In previous lessons, you imagined yourself as an operations manager,

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:09,020
doing analysis to help with inventory planning.

3
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:11,200
You looked at minimum, maximum,

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,580
and average order sizes,

5
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,055
to get a sense of what size order Parch and Posey

6
00:00:15,055 --> 00:00:18,515
should be prepared to fulfill at any given time.

7
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:21,340
Really though, the best way to understand this,

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,885
would be to look at percentiles,

9
00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:25,310
to see where the most orders fall.

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:28,000
We can do this with the NTILE window function.
