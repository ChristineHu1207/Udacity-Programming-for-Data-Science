00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
So now we know which paper types are most popular and we have

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:07,089
a sense of the largest order size we might need to fulfill at any given time.

3
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:09,300
But what's the average order size?

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,000
What can we expect to see on a regular basis?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,245
We'll use the average function which is typed as

6
00:00:14,244 --> 00:00:19,339
AVG and has a similar syntax to all of the other aggregation functions.

7
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:23,184
So it looks like that large poster paper order must have been a major outlier

8
00:00:23,184 --> 00:00:25,179
because the average poster order is only

9
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:27,774
about a third the size of the average standard order.

10
00:00:27,774 --> 00:00:30,039
When you're using the average function,

11
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,850
keep in mind that it can only be used on numerical columns.

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,085
Also, it ignores nulls completely,

13
00:00:36,085 --> 00:00:38,829
meaning that rows with null values are not counted in

14
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:42,284
the numerator or the denominator when calculating the average.

15
00:00:42,284 --> 00:00:44,169
If you want to treat nulls as zero,

16
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:46,030
you'll need to take a sum and divide it by

17
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:49,000
the count rather than just using the average function.
