1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,880
The NTILE function allows you to see the percentile

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:05,925
or any other subdivision that a given row falls into.

3
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:07,230
As you can see here,

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:09,690
the number specified in the NTILE function is

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,955
the number of parts into which you'll divide the window.

6
00:00:12,955 --> 00:00:15,110
One hundred means percentiles,

7
00:00:15,110 --> 00:00:18,715
five means quintiles, and four means quartiles.

8
00:00:18,715 --> 00:00:23,760
In this case, order by determines which column to use to determine the quartiles,

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,640
here using standard quantity.

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,180
For each row, the NTILE four function will look at the value of standard quantity in

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,790
that row compared to all the other rows in

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,435
the window and then print the quartile that the value falls into.

13
00:00:40,435 --> 00:00:43,960
So, a standard quantity of zero would fall in the first quartile,

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,580
while the highest value would fall in the fourth quartile.
