00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,394
Some queries, also known as inner queries or nested queries,

2
00:00:04,394 --> 00:00:08,099
are a tool for performing operations in multiple steps.

3
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,969
For example, let's put our marketing manager hats back on.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,890
We'd like to know which channels send

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:17,880
the most traffic per day on average to Patch and Posey.

6
00:00:17,879 --> 00:00:22,884
In order to do that, we'll need to aggregate events by channel by day,

7
00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:26,820
then we need to take those and average them.
