1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,395
Imagine yourself as an operations manager at Parch & Posey.

2
00:00:03,395 --> 00:00:05,519
You're trying to do some inventory planning,

3
00:00:05,519 --> 00:00:08,689
and you want to know how much of each paper type to produce.

4
00:00:08,689 --> 00:00:11,515
A good place to start might be to total up

5
00:00:11,515 --> 00:00:14,600
all sales of each paper type and compare them to one another.

6
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:16,995
We'll do this using SUM.

7
00:00:16,995 --> 00:00:18,730
It works similarly to COUNT,

8
00:00:18,730 --> 00:00:22,885
except that you'll want to specify column names rather than using star.

9
00:00:22,885 --> 00:00:25,540
It looks like standard is more popular than

10
00:00:25,539 --> 00:00:28,884
both of the non-standard paper types combined.

11
00:00:28,885 --> 00:00:34,993
Unlike COUNT, you can only use the SUM function on columns containing numerical values.

12
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:37,865
You don't need to worry too much about the presence of nulls.

13
00:00:37,865 --> 00:00:40,000
The SUM function will just treat nulls as zero.
