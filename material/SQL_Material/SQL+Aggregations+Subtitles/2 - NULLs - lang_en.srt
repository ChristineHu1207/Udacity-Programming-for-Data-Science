00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,084
Before we dive into aggregation,

2
00:00:02,084 --> 00:00:05,195
we need to cover one more concept, Nulls.

3
00:00:05,195 --> 00:00:07,145
Null means no data.

4
00:00:07,144 --> 00:00:09,779
It's different from a zero or a space.

5
00:00:09,779 --> 00:00:12,794
And there's a good reason. From a business perspective,

6
00:00:12,794 --> 00:00:16,184
for Parch & Posey a zero means that no paper was sold,

7
00:00:16,184 --> 00:00:19,019
which could mean that a sale was attempted but not made.

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,689
A null could mean no sale was even attempted.

9
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,640
And that's a pretty meaningful difference.

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,815
Those could be the result of any number of things,

11
00:00:27,815 --> 00:00:30,300
they can be part of the data design itself or

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,295
they can simply be the result of poorly locked data.

13
00:00:33,295 --> 00:00:35,340
Regardless, it's important to understand

14
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:38,140
what nulls mean and to know how to work with them.
