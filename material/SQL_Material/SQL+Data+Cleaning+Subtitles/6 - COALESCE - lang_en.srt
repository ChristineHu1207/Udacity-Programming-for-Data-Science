1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,300
Occasionally, you'll end up with a data set that has

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:06,804
some nulls that you'd prefer to contain actual values.

3
00:00:06,804 --> 00:00:08,564
Looking at the accounts table,

4
00:00:08,564 --> 00:00:14,557
you might want to clearly label a no primary point of contact as no POC,

5
00:00:14,557 --> 00:00:17,464
so the results will be easily understandable.

6
00:00:17,464 --> 00:00:23,920
In cases like this, you can use coalesce to replace the null values.

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,769
This is something you may want to do frequently when using

8
00:00:29,769 --> 00:00:33,490
numerical data where you might want to display nulls as zero.

9
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:37,450
Also, when performing outer joins that result in some unmatched rows,

10
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:42,190
you may want those unmatched rows to display something other than a null value.

11
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:45,759
Of course, this is most valuable when working with a function that treats

12
00:00:45,759 --> 00:00:50,789
nulls differently from zero such as a count or an average.

13
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,129
We can demonstrate this by wrapping the coalesce in

14
00:00:54,130 --> 00:01:02,100
a count function and counting the primary POC column without the coalesce, as well.

15
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:08,155
As you can see, the count that includes the coalesce,

16
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:12,489
includes nine more results than the other regular
