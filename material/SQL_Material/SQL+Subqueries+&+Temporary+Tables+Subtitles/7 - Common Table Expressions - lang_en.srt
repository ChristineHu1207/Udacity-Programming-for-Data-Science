1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,070
If you have a common table expression or subquery that takes a really long time to run,

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:07,710
you might want to run it as a completely separate query and

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,109
then write it back into the database as it's own table.

4
00:00:11,109 --> 00:00:14,459
Then, you can simply query the new table as you would any other,

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,100
to finish the things you're trying to calculate.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,935
The big benefit to this approach is that you can improve the speed at which you explore.

7
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:25,289
Let's say you've got a subquery that takes an hour to write,

8
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:27,899
and then you've got an outer query that's pretty fast.

9
00:00:27,899 --> 00:00:32,024
If you run both of them every time you want to make a small tweak to the outer query,

10
00:00:32,024 --> 00:00:34,030
you're going to get really frustrated.

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,280
Instead, you can run that inner query once and write it to a table,

12
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,039
then iterating on the outer query will be quick and easy.

13
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:45,420
We'll dig into performance in more depth in later lessons.

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,910
For now, we'll focus on writing your subqueries and

15
00:00:47,909 --> 00:00:51,000
common table expressions into the database as new tables.
