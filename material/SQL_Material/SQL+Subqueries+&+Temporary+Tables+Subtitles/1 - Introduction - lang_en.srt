1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,700
At this point, you've learned all the basics.

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:05,724
You understand database structure,

3
00:00:05,724 --> 00:00:08,314
and generally know how to access information.

4
00:00:08,314 --> 00:00:11,570
You can even do some simple aggregations.

5
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,830
There are a few things left to learn that will make you

6
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:16,714
able to solve any problem you're confronted with.

7
00:00:16,714 --> 00:00:21,655
In this lesson, you're going to learn how to query from the results of another query.

8
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:24,775
This allows you to build more transformations into your query,

9
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,559
organize work more easily,

10
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,419
and even make your queries run faster.
