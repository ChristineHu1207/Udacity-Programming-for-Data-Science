00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,830
If we want to segment our data into even more granular chunks,

2
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,595
we can group by multiple columns.

3
00:00:07,594 --> 00:00:10,259
Imagine yourself as a marketing manager at Parch & Posey,

4
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:14,910
trying to understand how each account interacted with various advertising channels.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,204
Which channels are driving traffic and leading to purchases?

6
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:21,149
Are we investing in channels that aren't worth the cost?

7
00:00:21,149 --> 00:00:24,629
How much traffic are we obtaining from each channel?

8
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:27,599
One way we might begin to look into these questions,

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:29,835
is to count up all of the events for each channel,

10
00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:33,655
for each account ID.

11
00:00:33,655 --> 00:00:37,420
It looks like the really useful information here is in the events column.

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:43,135
Let's reorder this to highlight the highest volume channels for each account.

13
00:00:43,134 --> 00:00:49,674
You'll notice that account ID comes before events in the order by clause.

14
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,227
Here in the results,

15
00:00:51,228 --> 00:00:54,145
you can see that these are ordered first by account ID,

16
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:57,000
then by events within the account ID.
