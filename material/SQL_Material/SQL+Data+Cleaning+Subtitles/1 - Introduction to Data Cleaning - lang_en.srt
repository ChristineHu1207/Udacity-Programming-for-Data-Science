1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
It's often the case, the data isn't structured exactly as you'd like.

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,135
In a couple of lessons,

3
00:00:06,134 --> 00:00:07,910
you worked with the web events table,

4
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:12,490
which contains a refer URL that's well pretty messy.

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,240
In this lesson, you'll learn a number of

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,344
techniques for cleaning and reorganizing messy data,

7
00:00:17,344 --> 00:00:19,750
so that you can group it the way you want.

8
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:21,420
You'll also learn how to change

9
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:25,890
your columns data type and some tricks for how to manipulate nulls.

10
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:27,120
Put all that together,

11
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,429
and you'll have a robust toolset for getting from

12
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,420
raw data to something that's very useful for analysis.
